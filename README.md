# Python-C--sync
with this version instead of a time interval triggering a sync i would be a python lib called watchdog that would cause this  
watchdog works in real time which results in less unneeded syncs  
the negative of this is this lib is managed by others and could become non functional  

method:  
python sync+wat.py /path/to/source /path/to/replica /path/to/logfile.txt
