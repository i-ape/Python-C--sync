# Python-C--sync
a program that synchronizes two folders: source and
replica. The program should maintain a full, identical copy of source
folder at replica folder.
Solve the test task by writing a program in one of these programming
languages:
Python
C#


 # rules 
 Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the
 replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source
 folder;  
Synchronization should be performed periodically;  
File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the
 console output;  
Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using
 the command line arguments;  
It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization;  
It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing
 other well-known algorithms. For example, there is no point in implementing yet
 another function that calculates MD5 if you need it for the task â€“ it is
 perfectly acceptable to use a third-party (or built-in) library;  

 in this branch i have provided my main answer the question with only python.  
 on the other branches of this repo there are some options for different use cases with other methods.
